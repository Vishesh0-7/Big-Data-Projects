# Chess Validator

## Description
The **Chess Validator** is a program designed to analyze chessboard positions and validate them according to the rules of chess. It identifies missing pieces, verifies positions, and detects errors such as invalid placements, conflicts, and duplicates.

This project demonstrates the use of **MapReduce** to process chess position data on a distributed system efficiently.
